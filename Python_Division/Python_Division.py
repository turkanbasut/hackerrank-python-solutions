# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
#
# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b . The second
# line should contain the result of float division,  a/ b.
#
# No rounding or formatting is necessary.

    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a//b)
    print(a/b)
